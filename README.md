Swag Labs is a demo e-commerce website that is commonly used for automation testing. In this project, I used selenium and Pytest and Pycharm for IDE
The approach to automation can involve using the Page Object Model (POM) to create a modular and maintainable test automation framework. The POM separates the test code from page-specific code, making it easier to update the test cases when the website changes.
